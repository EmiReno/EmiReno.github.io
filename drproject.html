	  <h1>Rationale for Project </h1>
	  <p> Distant Reading (DR) can be understood as one method of studying how literary texts evolve over a given period of time. 
		  DR allows a researcher to sift through quantitative and qualitative data retroactively, to better understand 
		  literary turns that may or may not influence future text topics or writing practices. However, to refine methodological uses of 
		  DR, the data collected needs to be scrutinized and categorized for comprehension. In other words, mass amounts of data are not useful
		  without narrowing the scope of interest. 
	   </p>
	  <p> This DR project will collect data from five most recent issues of <em>XChanges</em>, a popular rhetoric, writing, and technical communication 
		  journal, to compare the most frequently used word choices over a two-and-a-half-year period. The journal publishes issues twice annually, 
		  which may reflect a reoccuring or evolving theme within a given year. Five issues were chosen as a pilot study for ease of collection.
		  Each piece of writing in <em>XChanges</em> will be used: author biography, articles, interviews, and the bibliographies.
		  All writing collected will be processed by the free online software TagCrowd to provide a visual representation of <em>XChanges's</em>
		  annual themes.

	  <h1>Rationale for Project </h1>
	  <p> Distant Reading (DR) can be understood as one method of studying how literary texts evolve over a given period of time. 
		  DR allows a researcher to sift through quantitative and qualitative data retroactively, to better understand 
		  literary turns that may or may not influence future text topics or writing practices. However, to refine methodological uses of 
		  DR, the data collected needs to be scrutinized and categorized for comprehension. In other words, mass amounts of data are not useful
		  without narrowing the scope of interest. 
	   </p>
	  <p> This DR project will collect data from five most recent issues of <em>XChanges</em>, a popular rhetoric, writing, and technical communication 
		  journal, to compare the most frequently used word choices over a two-and-a-half-year period. The journal publishes issues twice annually, 
		  which may reflect a reoccuring or evolving theme within a given year. Five issues were chosen as a pilot study for ease of collection.
		  Each piece of writing in <em>XChanges</em> will be used: editorial introductions, author biography, articles, interviews, and the bibliographies.
		  All writing collected data will be processed by the free online software TagCrowd to provide a visual representation of <em>XChanges's</em>
		  annual themes.
	  </p>
	  	  
	  <h1>Discussion of Findings</h1>
	  
	<p>
		The data collected represents five issues of <em>XChanges</em> over a two-and-a-half year period with each issue, in its entirety, acting 
		as a single data unit. The word clouds generated by TagCrowd (see below) provided three trends of information from the data collection of 
		<em>XChanges</em>: reoccuring words amongst the issues, terms logically associated with Digital Rhetoric, and outliers associated with
		topic-specific articles.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Of the five most cited words, as defined by TagCrowd, three occure twice within the five issue sample of <em>XChanges</em>: 
		Students (Issues 12.2/13.1 and  13.2), Writing (Issues 12.2/13.1 and 13.2), and Users (Issues 14.1 and 12.1). The repetition 
		suggests topics of interest within <em>XChanges</em> and the field of Digital Rhetoric as a whole. The term Students and Users
		may be used interchangeably or be used as a subcategories (e.g. Users, specifically <em>students</em>, or Students, who are 
		<em>users</em> of technology).
		  <!-- Answer: So, What?-->
	<p>
		As expected, at least one of every most cited word per issue of <em>XChanges</em> relates to Digital Rhetoric: Digital, Reading,
		Ethos, Rhetorical, Design, Social, and Feedback, amongst others. As <em>XChanges</em> publishes twice annually, the Fall issue is dedicated 
		to the publishing of undergraduate students, while the Spring issue publishes interviews and research work from graduate level associates.
		
	  <blockquote cite="http://www.xchanges.org/about">"Our Fall issue each year features undergraduate research.  Our Spring issue features graduate-student research.  In each undergraduate issue, 
		we publish theses and research projects of upper-level undergraduate students.  Our graduate-student issues feature MA- and Ph.D.-level original 
		research from emerging professionals in our focal fields."
	  </blockquote>
		<!-- Answer: So, What?-->
	</p>
	  <p>
		<em>XChanges</em> promotes the work of undergraduate and graduate researchers in separate issues as stated above. The term "outliers",
		in this project, works to inform the variability of <em>XChanges'</em> trends. Of the five issues sampled, two appear to fit this variable category,
		Issue 11.2 and 12.2/13.1. Issue 12.2/13.1's word hierarchy contains three words that reflects its categorization of "outlier": Meat, Processed,
		  and Red. Issue 11.2 contains Driscoll and James which reflect their student-topics of interest.

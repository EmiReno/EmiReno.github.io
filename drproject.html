	  <h1>Rationale for Project </h1>
	  <p> Distant Reading (DR) can be understood as one method of studying how literary texts evolve over a given period of time. 
		  DR allows a researcher to sift through quantitative and qualitative data retroactively, to better understand 
		  literary turns that may or may not influence future text topics or writing practices. However, to refine methodological uses of 
		  DR, the data collected needs to be scrutinized and categorized for comprehension. In other words, mass amounts of data are not useful
		  without narrowing the scope of interest. 
	   </p>
	  <p> This DR project will collect data from five most recent issues of <em>XChanges</em>, a popular rhetoric, writing, and technical communication 
		  journal, to compare the most frequently used word choices over a two-and-a-half-year period. The journal publishes issues twice annually, 
		  which may reflect a reoccuring or evolving theme within a given year. Five issues were chosen as a pilot study for ease of collection.
		  Each piece of writing in <em>XChanges</em> will be used: editorial introductions, author biography, articles, interviews, and the bibliographies.
		  All writing collected data will be processed by the free online software TagCrowd to provide a visual representation of <em>XChanges's</em>
		  annual themes.
	  </p>
	  	  
	  <h1>Discussion of Findings</h1>
	  
	<p>
		The data collected represents five issues of <em>XChanges</em> over a two-and-a-half year period with each issue, in its entirety, acting 
		as a single data unit. The word clouds generated by TagCrowd (see below) provided three trends of information from the data collection of 
		<em>XChanges</em>: reoccuring words amongst the issues, terms logically associated with Digital Rhetoric, and outliers associated with
		topic-specific articles. All data available in each issue was used because of its publication within the online journal. The Editor's
		Introduction, Author's Biography, and the Bibliography were included to assist in developing topic trends.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Of the five most cited words, as defined by TagCrowd, three occure twice within the five issue sample of <em>XChanges</em>: 
		Students (Issues 12.2/13.1 and  13.2), Writing (Issues 12.2/13.1 and 13.2), and Users (Issues 14.1 and 12.1). The repetition 
		suggests topics of interest within <em>XChanges</em> and the field of Digital Rhetoric as a whole. The term Students and Users
		may be used interchangeably or be used as a subcategories (e.g. Users, specifically <em>students</em>, or Students, who are 
		<em>users</em> of technology).
		  <!-- I feel I'm missing the big "so, what" answer here.-->
	<p>
		As expected, at least one of every most cited word per issue of <em>XChanges</em> relates to Digital Rhetoric: Digital, Reading,
		Ethos, Rhetorical, Design, Social, and Feedback, amongst others. As <em>XChanges</em> publishes twice annually, the Fall issue is dedicated 
		to the publishing of undergraduate students, while the Spring issue publishes interviews and research work from graduate level associates.
		
	  <blockquote cite="http://www.xchanges.org/about">"Our Fall issue each year features undergraduate research.  Our Spring issue features graduate-student research.  In each undergraduate issue, 
		we publish theses and research projects of upper-level undergraduate students.  Our graduate-student issues feature MA- and Ph.D.-level original 
		research from emerging professionals in our focal fields."
	  </blockquote>
	</p>
	  <p>
		<em>XChanges</em> promotes the work of undergraduate and graduate researchers in separate issues as stated above. The term "outliers",
		in this project, works to inform the variability of <em>XChanges'</em> trends. Of the five issues sampled, two appear to fit this variable category,
		Issue 11.2 and 12.2/13.1. Issue 12.2/13.1's word hierarchy contains three words that reflects its categorization of "outlier": Meat, Processed,
		  and Red. Issue 11.2 contains Driscoll and James which reflect their student-topics of interest.
	</p>
		  
	  <h1>Future Considerations</h1>
	  
	<p>
		This Distant Reading project utilized TagCrowd's word cloud capabilities to visualize retroactively the word trends of th <em>XChanges</em>, 
		a digital rhetorical journal.While three trends were discussed, five issues over a two-and-a-half year did present enough data to 
		decipher literary turns associated with the digital rhetoric journal. More data is needed from <em>XChanges</em> archives, which is available,
		to assist in quantifying any trends beyond Students, Users, and Writing. Of the data collected for this project, the Author's Biography and
		Editor's Introduction may be of the least concern. These two pieces of information may act as "noise" as this project's DR is to
		visualize the content of <em>XChanges</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This project discovered the limitations of TagCrowd when dividing the collected articles into undergraduate and graduate work. The researcher
		wanted to see if trends were possible between the two categories of the given two-and-a-half year period. However, TagCrowd could not accomodate
		the massive amount of data imposed on it. To further dissect the data collected, the researcher may isolate the bibliographies of the undergraduate
		and graduate work to determine if specific authors or topics of interest are common.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Distant Reading Project visualizes how rapidly trends shift within a short period of time. In this project, trends are described as the most 
		cited word in each of <em>XChanges'</em> five issues. These trends assist Digital Rhetoricians with establishing how often trends arise or how
		short-lived they may be. <em>XChanges</em> provides a limited snapshot at past conversations, or topics of interest, to assist in determining
		future trends. The data presented also looks to identify the journal's identity over the two-and-a-half year period as it oscilates between undergraduate
		and graduat-level showcasing of work. This oscillation of identity may allow the journal to reach a wider audience with an interest within the DigiRhet scope.
		<!--Just like the discussion section, I feel I don't answer the "so, what" question. I'll return to this page as part of my routine clean up.
			I need to do this for my other three pages-->
		<!-- Housekeeping question: Would breaking up the content with paragraphs or breaks be easier for readability? I'm partial to paragraphs,
			but that may be due to my processor habits as discussed before-->

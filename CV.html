  <h2>Personal Statement<h2>
  
    <p>My undergraduate career focused on the microbiological and immunological sciences with an emphasis on marine bacteria and human health. I will complete my English MA at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi December 2019 with a focus on writing studies. My well-rounded education had prepared me to work and lead in specialized disciplines while relaying my findings to the community through my communications training.

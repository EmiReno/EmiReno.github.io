  <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>My undergraduate career focused on the microbiological and immunological sciences with an emphasis on marine bacteria and human health.

My well-rounded education had prepared me to work and lead in specialized disciplines while relaying my findings to the community through my communications training.

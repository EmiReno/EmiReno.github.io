    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in my portfolio.
	<br>My name is Emille (<em>Eh mih lee</em>) Moreno, and I am actively pursuing my Master of Arts in English at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. </br>
	    A&M Corpus has been my academic home for several years; I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology with a minor in
			<br> Creative Writing in 2016. </br>
    </p>

    <p>
    I briefly pursued one year of a Master of Science in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics before enrolling into the English MA program. 
	    <br>My academic trajectory shifted as I better understood my interests in developing my skills as a writer, both within the sciences and the</br> 
	    humanities.
    </p>

    <p>
    My educational goals do not end with my English MA from A&M Corpus. I will pursue my PhD in healthcare administration to assist in policy 
	    <br>making in either a teaching or research hospital.  I have an interest in both health literacy and special populations (prosthesis and orthotics)</br>
		administration. Within the realm of healthcare, I feel there is a disconnect between administration and the community, which I will address with 
	<br>my scientific background and my writing studies from A&M Corpus.</br>
    </p>

    <p>
    While San Antonio, Texas is my home, I have left footprints across the United States and a few countries throughout the world. I am an avid hiker with dirt crusting 
	    <br>my boots from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Florida. My soles have also crossed into the culturally different biospheres of Mexico, Italy, </br>
		the Cayman Islands, Honduras, and Scotland.

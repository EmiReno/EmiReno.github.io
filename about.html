    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="IMG_002.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Site's author smiling">
	  <p> Thank you for your interest in my portfolio. </p>
	<p>
	  My name is Emille (<em>Eh mih lee</em>) Moreno, and I am actively pursuing my Master of Arts in English at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi.
	  A&M Corpus has been my academic home for several years; I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology with a minor in Creative Writing in 2016.
    </p>

    <p>
    I briefly pursued one year of a Master of Science in Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics before enrolling into the English MA program. 
	    My academic trajectory shifted as I better understood my interests in developing my skills as a writer, both within the sciences and the humanities.
    </p>

    <p>
    My educational goals do not end with my English MA from A&M Corpus. I will pursue my PhD in Healthcare Administration to assist in policy 
	    making in either a teaching or research hospital.  I have an interest in both health literacy and special populations (prosthesis and orthotics) 
	    administration. Within the realm of healthcare, I feel there is a disconnect between administration and the community, which I will address with 
	    my scientific background and my writing studies from A&M Corpus.
    </p>

    <p>
    While San Antonio, Texas is my home, I have left footprints across the United States and a few countries throughout the world. I am an avid hiker with dirt crusting  
	    my boots from Arizona, Colorado, California, and Florida. My soles have also crossed into the culturally different biospheres of Mexico, Italy, the Cayman Islands, Honduras, and Scotland.

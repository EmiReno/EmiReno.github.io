    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I came to this class excited to revisit my familarity with coding as I have an associates degree in networking technology and I have worked in computer science for 15 years. What I didn't expect was how much my interest in creative writing and my experience with software as a disabilities aid, would inform what we studied and shaped here. The assignment was intended to have us think in dynamic ways about reading bodies of text. It was also intended to have us think critically about how word clouds can both build and deconstruct digital rhetoric. Again, I would point to the, not so much evidence as preponderance, that many powerful organizations fund and pour resources into variations of word clouds from data visualization to word frequency lists and charts. Similar types of information gathering, analyzing, and shaping are used by marketing executives, the FBI, Cambridge Analytica, military intelligence, and sociologists. On another level, it is also used for humor, entertainment, and compelling presentations whether legitimate or ______.

  <p>This second set of industry applications are no less powerful in that they are more precisely whittled to the sharp point of persuasion rather than objective data. It is in this aspect that we can also see the proverbial ‘slippery slope’. The simple and appealing nature of word clouds can lend themselves more to unqualified affectations of valid research. But I do feel that studying them closely makes us more meta-aware of insinuations into the bedding of our judgement. For example, hearing the proceedings of the Trump impeachment, muffled in the background of my workplace break room, I could distinctly hear the phrase ‘the Democrats’ at almost perfectly timed intervals. I was aware of how this phrase was punctuated and repeated in a way that is comparable to ‘the hook’ of a catchy ‘ear-worm’ song. I believe this was fully intentional as a way to implant an understanding of the proceedings as an accusation, not against the accused, but against the accusers. It even gives the impression that the accusers are the Democrats as opposed to a non-partisan inquiry on behalf of the American people. The punctuation and repetition of the phrase is a rhetoric and the ability to only hear it over muffled conversation was a type of word cloud which deconstructs that rhetoric. Subvert a straightforward narrative. Show us where the speaker, editor, subculture, etc place importance; show their perspective. To show who IS a speaker as with the recent practice of determining how many words are spoken by women or people of color in movies and television. To examine gaze and objectification but not in the way those words are commonly used. A potential use may be to analyze writing samples of different groups of students such as students with disabilities or those with lower income.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>After discussing with my classmates, I realized that “useful” is a very subjective word and that the backgrounds that we talked about previously will influence a lot what find or not helpful. Sidney, for instance, said that they found the word clouds were not really useful because the words were not contextualized; in other words, we lacked the information necessary to know what those words we were seeing were referencing, which will not allow us to get a clear idea about the issues. I found this perspective interesting, mostly because for me it was the opposite. What I find the most useful about these word clouds is the fact that it allows us to just get a sense of what could be waiting for us, should we choose to look deeper into the issues at the origin of the word cloud. I gave the clear example of Kelsy Mascorro’s word clouds—which I would go on record just to say that they are the most beautiful word clouds of the ones created, aesthetically speaking. But, even if we take the colors and writing font away, it was by looking at Kelsy’s word clouds that I first realized why word clouds were useful and what they were useful for. Most of the words found on Kelsy’s word clouds referred to topics that I’m very interested in, such as feminism, sexuality, women, etc., and it was after seeing those clouds that I had the idea of going to the webpage of the journal she made them from, and actually looking at the different articles they have published. I found the journal, Peitho, to have a strong feminist focus. I went through their page, even clicked the “submit” button to check their guidelines because, why not, maybe one day I could send an article to that journal. So, I think that this could definitely be a way that word clouds could be useful: to give a snapshot of what you may—or may not—find in a journal. And even if the lack of context might lead to disappointment, it can also be a way for a new grad student to get acquainted with what is out there.</p>
    <p>When discussing the creative writing perspective of this project, Philly and Emille seemed to have different views. While Emille said that she didn’t really see this project as coming from any creative perspective, Philly said that they felt this project was all about creative writing. Having these two different approaches out there brought us to question how this project could let see the “story” behind the journal issues and how those random words could eventually depict a greater context of what is happening in the field. To that, I added that I had found some use for them after doing the project, when I understood that I could use word clouds with my texts, and use it to see the big topics of my writing. Brooke (2009) talks about the difference between types of word clouds, mainly dynamic vs static ones; dynamic ones being those who change every certain time to reflect the most recent keywords of articles or webpages. This is something that really spoke to me when it comes to using word clouds for my work. In fact, depending on what we want the word clouds to show, we can pick a different type. I think that both have different things they can be useful for; while the dynamic cloud could offer a more up-to-date and immediate idea of what an author/scholar is working on, a static one could be a good way to keep track of certain moments in research/writing history. This last one could also help with the idea of memory, expressed by Brooke (2009). These word clouds could be really helpful to help build a history of my research and how it has evolved throughout the years.</p>
    <p>Mueller (2017) cautions us that we should not underestimate the importance of word clouds just because they are "fun," "casual," and "methodologically casual," when, in fact, word clouds can be good indicators of trends and threshold concepts concerning the studied texts. I think that this part was what tricked many of us when doing this assignment. From what I could hear from my classmates who did not find the assignment useful, there seemed to be mixed feelings as long as what this tool could do. I wonder whether part of that had to do with the already laid-back nature of the word clouds. Is it easier to find something useless if we think it is fun? I would venture to speculate that maybe this assignment threw off many of us, whether we were at the beginning or at the end of our program. For those of us starting the program, it could have been a matter of this type of assignment not corresponding to what we would traditionally expect as a grad school assignment—the first thing we might have been expecting were papers and research. For those who have been in the program for longer, it might also have been the case that they were used to writing papers, and this exercise caught them out of guard. This might speak to how hard it is to conciliate traditional scholarship with newer methods of conveying information.</p>
    <p>So, although I thought these word clouds were useful, it became evident that it was not the case for many—if not most—of my classmates. This brings me to raise a question, and it is whether I really feel they are that useful that I would actually go ahead and use them—as opposed to just say what they could be useful for. Maybe the skepticism from those of my classmates who found them useless has to do with the fact that they know actually using this tool would be a lot of hassle for little benefit. There are so many factors that influence the way we feel about word clouds in general and this assignment in particular, that it is hard to give a concrete answer as to whether they are or not useful. It is better to speak from personal experience, which is what I attempted to do. As the discipline grows, and maybe word clouds become a main element of this new disciple, we might be able to coin a definite answer. For now, we will have to depend on our personal approaches and experiences.</p>

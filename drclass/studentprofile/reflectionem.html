    <h3>Reflection</h3> <!-- or [Journal 1.0 Findings]/Journal 2.0 Findings-->
    <h4>Perceptions of Rhetoric</h4>
    <p> “How can I apply something, when I don’t understand it in the first place?” I kept thinking when I was first introduced to rhetoric in my first Spring semester of my English masters. When I think “rhetoric” or “rhetorician”, I immediately imagine the philosophers of yore orating about some niche insight with an audience hanging on their every word. I could not tell anyone as to why I imagined an Aristotle, Plato, or the other astronomical-sounding names, simply shouting amidst an audience, they just were. I have only ever heard “rhetoric” used in an academic setting, specifically in the humanities. This has led me to, previously, regard rhetoric as a mythical ivory tower, where only the most prestigious of academics can achieve. Why? What stories have been told of rhetoricians or the humanities that led me to this imaginative story? </p>
    <p> I cannot say I have a clear grasp of rhetoric, even now with my English masters practically complete. Unfortunately, the Five Canons of Rhetoric were never explored in my undergraduate career as a science major. We did not see a need to explore tenets so rooted in the humanities. This led to a gap in my education as I entered a humanities master’s program. I felt even less sure of my understanding as my final course of the program explained that not even the rhetoricians could succinctly explain these Five Canons. Collin Brooke (2009) says it best, “The canons have so completely diffused into our collective conceptions of rhetoric that they are almost beneath our notice, and yet most rhetoric and composition scholars would struggle to explain exactly what the canons are” (p. 29). Brooke’s work gave me an idea, one that I am clinging to, what if rhetoric is a skill we learn unconsciously? If the rhetoric situation is dependent on our environment, the niche ecology, we learn how to communicate with our target audience, speak the language that will incite action, as it (unknowingly) encompasses the Five Canons (Invention, Arrangement, Style, Memory, and Delivery). The trick, then, would be to make these unconscious actions conscious, to better move between multiple rhetorical situations that are will incite action. Understanding and utilizing the rhetorical situation through language to incite action, that is what Rhetoric means to me. </p>
    <h4>Explorations of Digital Rhetoric<h4>
      <p> If understanding rhetoric was difficult enough, the constantly shifting landscape of digital rhetoric was an overwhelming challenge. The introduction of the ever-shifting audience superhighway that is the internet, makes understanding the rhetorical situation even more daunting. Returning to my imaginative story of astronomical-sounding rhetoricians, I honestly imagined a one-way exchange between the them and the audience. I imagined rhetoric as this disseminating of information without feedback from the audience because only another rhetorician could “retort”. </p>
      <h5>Beginning of the Course</h5>
      <p> Modern day rhetoric, from my original understanding, relies on feedback from the audience in either driving discourse through action (again) or walking away (failure to communicate). This was not true even in the nondigital age as I learned. My final semester of my graduate program emphasized the possibilities and challenges digital rhetoric offers inside and outside academia. The digital age levels the field where anyone can act as the rhetorician; no more lofty towers for high-brow academics. What does this mean for the rhetoric situation as a student still trying to gasp these concepts? Douglas Eyman (2015) writes, “In addition to addressing the roles and activities of the speaker/writer, communication/text, and audience/reader, … digital communication needs to account for context, interactivity, and circulation (via internetworked systems)” (p. 93). The rhetorical situation must be adjusted to fit human and non-human entities (computers, phones, etc.) that assist in the shaping of the Five Canons. </p>
      <h5>End of the Course</h5>
      <p> Interestingly, the more aware of the steps I took to communicate with my chosen audience (my rhetorical situation) the more aware of my actions I became. For instances, the final course of my English masters (my digital rhetoric course) explored the creation of personal ecologies through online portfolios. We built these websites first to become familiar with building conventions associated with some portfolio websites like including: a homepage to highlight ourselves, an about me page to explore current research and related interests, and finally, the ever-coveted resume/CV. I think what assisted me in learning about the rhetorical situation, was the creation of my space to interact with a chosen audience to incite an action. In this example, the action was promoting myself as an employable candidate for a hypothetical job. Assignments like this work best for me to learn about (digital) rhetoric, because it brought this high-brow, high-theory imagery into the trenches of application. 
	Our end of course project looks to explore two goals: what information can be found through the distant reading of five Digital Rhetoric journals and how does identity shape individual understandings of these distant readings. Eyman (2015) writes, “distant reading takes a long view, examining the text as one among mangy and considering a much larger corpus whose contexts and relationships give rise to different forms of meaning” (95). Our distant reading corpus was taken from preselected digital rhetoric journals and visually represented through word clouds. These word clouds visualize the frequency of word usage, but how can they represent different forms of meaning? During a class discussion, we vocalized how we constructed our corpora, and I realized how variable our clouds were to one another. This variability gave me the opportunity to explore how previous experiences construct knowledge making activities that are central, I think, to rhetoric.</p>
      <h4>Roots of Identity</h4>
      <p> As previously stated, I do not have a humanities undergraduate background. My scientific identity prefers to work and explore concepts (like the Canons) through applications exercises like the portfolio building and class project. I prefer having a hands-on approach to exploring theories than reading and discussing. For me, reading and discussing high theory, even with examples, does not assist me in application (performing) because I am unable to make mistakes in a way I am used to. For example, my identity as an undergraduate laboratory researcher, I could read and understand the theory of making agar plates/broth and know how to grow bacteria (I was privileged to work in a marine microbiology lab), but unless I practiced I would never be able to perform my work and enter the rhetorical situation (showcasing of work at conferences or publish). I think the same mental block arose in my first rhetoric course, which left me uneasy in this semester’s digital rhetoric.</p>
      <p>In addition, I was having difficulty adapting my creative writing interests and background into the digital rhetoric course. My master’s thesis project focused on the exploration of historical narratives that had not been explored because these voices were considered silent and unimportant. The course project’s word clouds did not initially fit into this mold and I was at a loss of how to make sense of these visualized word frequencies that did not “tell a story”. However, one of our class discussions focused on exploring word clouds through the lens of creative writing. Two of my classmates suggested that the word clouds provide, not only a frequency of buzzwords, but an opportunity to explore the relationship between these buzzwords – that sounds like a story in the making to me! I then shift my thoughts to explore how the interconnectedness of words in my corpus created a story of my preselected digital rhetoric journal. What assumptions (stories) can be created by my classmates’ unique corpora, and what can we then extrapolate as the story (trends) of the digital rhetoric genre? For me, our class project gives me the opportunity to see how words in combination and alone reinforce or dismantle my previous imagery of rhetoric.</p>
      <h4>Non-Academic Applications</h4>
      <p> One of the major questions of the project and rhetoric, in general, is what is its usefulness outside academia? I am still grappling with this question for my non-academic purposes, but I especially did not see rhetoric-in-action during my first exposure to it. Prior to my undertaking of digital rhetoric, my exposure to rhetoric was classroom-central, specifically with regards to teaching writing. I was confused by the ideas of “writing is an activity” and “writing is knowledge making”. Of course, many of these ideas came from Naming What We Know by Linda Adler-Kassner, but we focused on the teacher edition, rather than the classroom version. Looking back, I think the course expected some background in rhetoric and previous exposure to the NWWK threshold concepts. Again, this book reinforced the ivory tower high-brow academic.
	However, because the digital rhetoric course emphasized “playing” which assisted in my development of the rhetorical situation and how to adapt in different ecologies. As previously stated, I believe (digital) rhetoric looks to explore the conscious actions throughout the exchange between speaker/audience and inciting action. Even our word clouds have some use outside academia. One of my classmates, during a class discussion, emphasized how these word clouds can be used to explore the buzzwords of the rhetoric situation. As the word clouds visually present the most frequently used words, they allow potential employees or grant writers in crafting their resumes and documents to enter this rhetorical situation. I liked this explanation my classmates offered because it offered a tangible reason to explore word clouds. 
I am interested in entering an administrative position in either a teaching or research hospital, and while word clouds my not be common, they may act as a tool to exploring these buzzwords. Hospital policy making works to reinforce the associations between patient, healthcare teams, community, among others. Word clouds may provide other associative words that build the story of the current healthcare practices to see if certain words are or are not used. For example, word clouds can assist in exploring the frequency of policy that specifically works with certain patient populations, what populations are explored more than others, what other buzz words are associated with them (budget/finance, servicing, underdeveloped, socioeconomic). This information allows administration to explore the rhetorical situation of these words and their nonfiction stories of patient care.</p>

<h5>Word-watching commentary</h5>

	<p><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> is an online journal that focuses on learning, teaching, and technology. Since it has a rolling submissions and publications system, I took six consecutive articles and considered them an issue. They were numbered 1 through 5, from oldest through most recent.
	</p>

<p>Using TagCrowd I generated one workcloud per issue, with the hundred most recurrent words. The best words. A hundred words seems to be a manageable amount in order to guess trends effectively.
	</p>

<p>As the name of the journal would suggest, the most used words in the articles were related to learning and instruction, with student being, by far, the most used in all five issues.
	</p>

<p>Here are some noticeable trends across these 5 wordclouds.
	</p>

<p>Learning became more frequent from issue one to issue five. Class and classroom started to emerge in issue one and consolidated through issue five. Course emerged in issue two but was not present in issue three and four, only to then make a comeback in issue five. Digital seemed to be picking up between issues one and three, to then die slowly giving way to design in issue five.
	</p>

<p>This journal remains devoted to students and education, and the wordclouds attest to this. If we were trying to predict a trend based on them, we could think of more focus on design in the future, which is a surprise considering that digital died out as design increased in frequency, and we would think those two words--or notions-- would pair well together. We can also see an emergence of the word syllabus, which could indicate that more focus is given to organized intruction. Although it could also respond to the beginning of the fall semester and the new school year.
	</p>

<p>This tool can be very helpful when defining what Digital Rhetoric is. At this point, I would define this term very roughly as having to do with the literature transmitted through and dealing with different types of media. I used to think of wordclouds as being just meant for fun and decorations, but now I can see how they play a role in conveying different trends in a particular journal or issue, while also being accessible to the general public. It is a very nice and helpful way to see what the journals are focusing on more concretely, and to know what are the points of interest are and eventually see which issues can be of more help when looking up specific information.
	<ul>
		<li><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> Issue I: Articles from August 10, 2017 to February 13, 2018. Students is the most used word, followed by work, college, digital, and teachers. We can see the main topics of the journal reflected in the words. </li>
		<li><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> Issue 2: Articles from February 16, 2018 to April 10, 2018. Once again, student is the most used word, followed by learning, course, class, and digital. Although the words are different from those in issue 1, they still relate to the same area, education. </li>
		<li><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> Issue 3: Articles from April 12, 2018 to June 14, 2018. Again, the most used word is students, followed by learning, educator, designers, and teaching. The fact that designers is following after digital was trending could mean that there will be more focus given to the digital aspect of the journal.</li>
		<li><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> Issue 4: Articles from June 22, 2018 to November 13, 2018. Students is the most used word, followed by learning, education, teaching, and pedagogy. Here, we are back to the more "traditional" words, it mimics to a certain extend what we saw in issue 1.</li>
		<li><cite>Hybrid Pedagogy</cite> Issue 5: Articles from December 6, 2018 to September 12, 2019. The most used word is, again, students, followed by learning, course,design, and work. Two other words that appeared frequently were Cheryl and Chris, which is most likely due to the transcript of an interview.</li>
